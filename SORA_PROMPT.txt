SORA VIDEO GENERATION PROMPT
============================

Title: "Valentine's Day Romantic Journey"

Description:
Create a cinematic 16-second video animation with the following sequence:

PHASE 1: LIGHT SPEED WARP (0-5 seconds)
- Start with a black void/space background
- Thousands of white stars scattered across the field
- Stars rapidly zoom towards the camera creating a "jumping to lightspeed" effect
- Add pink/magenta radial gradient pulses radiating outward from center
- Include horizontal streaks of pink light moving across the screen at high speed (warp lines)
- The entire effect creates the sensation of traveling through a wormhole at impossible speeds
- Opacity gradually fades to black as warp concludes

PHASE 2: BLACK HOLE FORMATION (5-10 seconds)
- Black background
- A massive black hole materializes in the center with a pink/magenta glow around the event horizon
- The black hole has:
  - Pink/magenta outer corona (like aurora borealis around a black hole)
  - Dark red middle band
  - Pure black center with subtle glowing singularity
  - Intense glowing rings of light
- The black hole expands from small (400px) to massive (2000px+) taking over entire screen
- The expansion creates the sensation of being pulled into the black hole
- Everything fades as the black hole consumes the view

PHASE 3: FLOWER BLOOMING (10-15 seconds)
- Beautiful purple-to-black gradient background (romantic nighttime garden feel)
- A single romantic flower grows from the ground up:
  - Green stem gradually grows upward (2.5 seconds)
  - Five pink petals bloom in sequence around the stem, each petal rotating 72 degrees apart
  - Each petal unfolds with a bouncy, joyful motion
  - A golden-to-pink heart-shaped center blooms last at the flower's core
  - Golden sparkles and particles float upward from the flower
  - The flower is perfectly centered and the focal point
- This represents hope and beauty emerging from darkness
- The flower fully blooms by 15 seconds

PHASE 4: TRANSITION FADE (15-16 seconds)
- The flower scene gradually fades to black
- A subtle pink glow lingers briefly
- Complete fade to black by 16 seconds

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:
- Resolution: 1920x1080 (Full HD)
